## Research Interests

My research aims to understand and forecast the response of vegetation to complex and interacting environmental changes. I take an ecological forecasting approach to account for uncertainties and predict how future ecosystems and their services will respond to a multitude of environmental changes, with the overall goal of managing ecological systems for a resilient future.

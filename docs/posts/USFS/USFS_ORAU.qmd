I am excited to announce that I am starting a new position as a ORAU Postdoctoral Research Scientist working in the Carbon Science Group (with Dr. Grant M. Domke) within the USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station.

In this position, I'll be working to model tree ring growth and mortality in Eastern US forests using historical tree ring data and forest inventory data (collected in the 1980's) to improve annual estimates of tree level growth and carbon stocks. Improved tree level estimates of carbon stock and change could help improve our baselines estimates of forest C.

I am excited to get started and looking forward to continue this line of work with the US Forest Service.

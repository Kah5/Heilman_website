I am so happy we can share that our manuscript documenting climate sensitivity across the entire range of Pinyon pine (*Pinus edulis*) is out now in PNAS!

This is a project I have been working on since 2020 with lead co-authors Dr. Margaret Evans, and Sharmila Dey, a student at Harvard Unversity. Sharmila began working in the Laboratory of Tree Ring Research on this project as as high school student, and we worked with coauthors to develop Bayesian models of tree ring growth across the range of *Pinus edulis*.

Check out the manuscript here: <https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2315700121>

The National Science Foundation (NSF) wrote up a nice piece about this work here: [" Widely used climate theory doesn't 'ring' true, according to new tree data"](https://new.nsf.gov/news/widely-used-climate-theory-doesnt-ring-true)\-- We love a good tree ring pun in the title!

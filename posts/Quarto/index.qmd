## Finally caved and started from scratch (ish) with Quarto

After several years of sporadically updating my website using Hugo and Academic hugo, I decided the past framework was too difficult to keep up with and started off with Quarto, which seems much more user friendly, with the preview options. I really liked the design and customization I had with my old website, so I hope to continue to customize my website with Quarto.
